    "main_text": "Welcome to the world of craft beer. Catraio Craft Beer Shop is a bar, which is a shop, which is a meeting place for whoever enjoys good (craft) beer.<br/>At Catraio, you are amongst friends to discover and enjoy new flavours, aromas and experiences. We offer you a laid back space so you can relax in downtown Porto, whether in the esplanade at Rua de Cedofeita or at the “beer garden”, during the Summer.<br />We are a platform for promoting craft beer, where you can find over 100 national and international beers and a passionate team is always available to help you make your choice. You can also participate in the launching of new beers, in meetups with master brewers, in “tap takeovers”, tastings and workshops. You can also take Catrio home, through our shop.<br />In 2015, we opened the first craft beer bar/shop in Porto and pioneered a new trend. Today, we maintain our commitment of celebrating this culture and finding new beers for you to discover."
